<h3>S-1 GRD Border Noise Removal</h3>
<p>The Sentinel-1 (S-1) Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) is
responsible for generating the complete family of Level-1 and Level-2
operation products. The processing of the RAW data into L1 products
features number of processing steps leading to artefacts at the image
borders.<br><br>These processing steps are mainly the azimuth and
/range compression and the sampling start time changes handling that is
necessary to compensate for the change of earth curvature. The latter
is generating a number of leading and trailing &#8220;no-value&#8221; samples that
depends on the data-take length that can be of several minutes. The
former creates radiometric artefacts complicating the detection of the
&#8220;no-value&#8221; samples.<br><br>These &#8220;no-value&#8221; pixels are not null but contain very low values which complicates the masking based on thresholding.<br><br>This
operator implements an algorithm proposed in [1] allowing masking the
"no-value" samples efficiently with thresholding method.<br><br>[1]
