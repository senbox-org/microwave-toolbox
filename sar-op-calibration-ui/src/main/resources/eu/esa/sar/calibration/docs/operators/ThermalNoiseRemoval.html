<h3>Thermal Noise Removal Operator&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Thermal noise correction can be applied to Sentinel-1 Level-1 SLC
products as well as Level-1 GRD products which have not already been
corrected. The operator can also remove this correction based on the
product annotations (i.e. to re-introduce the noise signal that was
removed). Product annotations will be updated accordingly to allow for
re-application of the correction.<br></p><p>Level-1 products provide a
noise LUT for each measurement data set. The values in the de-noise
LUT, provided in linear power, can<br>be used to derive calibrated noise profiles matching the calibrated GRD data.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bi-linear interpolation is used for any pixels that fall between points in the LUT.<br></p>
