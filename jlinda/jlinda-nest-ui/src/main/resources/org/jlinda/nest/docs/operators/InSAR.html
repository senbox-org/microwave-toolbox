<h3>Interferometric Functionality</h3>

<p>
    The processing setup for InSAR is similar like for the other functionalities. The set of interferometric
    operators is designed and chained into the graph via the Graph Processing Framework (GPF).
</p>

<p>
    For optimal interferometric processing, many of the core functionalities are improved and/or reimplemented
    to accommodate for the InSAR requirements. Some of the extended modules are , e.g., Warping function extended with
    <i>phase preserving</i> and more accurate interpolation kernels. While, the coregistration has been fully
    reimplemented and optimized for interferometric applications.
</p>


<h4>Implementation Overview</h4>

<p>Initially for InSAR functionality, as an algorithmic prototype the DORIS (Delft object-oriented radar interferometric
    software) software has been used. However, in the course of development many of these algorithmic prototypes have
    been further extended and completely reimplemented, and most of implementations significantly deviated from the
    original. Because of these developments, and in order to streamline and simplify further developments a dedicated
    library and application interface (API) for interferometric application is designed and
    developed - <a href="https://github.com/ppolabs/jlinda/">jLinda (Java Library for Interferometric Data
        Analysis)</a>.

<h5>Algorithmic Base</h5>

<p>All implemented algorithms are fully documented, described in the literature, and follow a generally accepted
    best practices.
