<h3>ETAD Correction for Sentinel-1 Products</h3>
<p> The operator applies the ETAD correction to Sentinel-1&nbsp;TOPS
SLC, Stripmap and GRD products.
The Extended Timing Annotation Dataset (ETAD) for Copernicus Sentinel-1
is a new auxiliary product developed by ESA in a joint effort with DLR.
It estimates the errors caused by the geophysical effects during
imaging and the errors introduced during the processing of the
Sentinel-1 SLC product. With the application of the ETAD correction,
the geometric accuracy of the Sentinel-1 SLC images could be improved
to centimetric levels.&nbsp;</p><p>This
operator performs ETAD correction to a given Sentinel-1 product in two
ways depending on the user's application which corresponds to the two
options in the UI (Figure 1) below. For Option 1, the&nbsp;operator
computes
for all pixels the range and azimuth offsets based on the user selected
ETAD correction layers, then resamples the image based on the computed
range and
azimuth offsets. It is for applications where the accurate geodetic
geolocation is required. Option 2 is for InSAR applications where
interferogram is generated using two ETAD corrected Sentinel-1 TOPS SLC
products.&nbsp;</p><p>For
TOPS SLC product,&nbsp;the&nbsp;operator currently requires the users
split the product into sub-swathes and applies the ETAD correction to each split product.&nbsp; </p><h4>Input</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The input to this operator could be the split Sentinel-1 TOPS SLC product, Stripmap SLC product or GRD product.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Output</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The output of the operator is the ETAD corrected product.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Parameters Used</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Auto-download ETAD File: If selected, the operator will
find the corresponding ETAD product for the source product and download
it automatically from the Copernicus Data Space.</li><li>Specify ETAD
File: In case the ETAD file is not available and cannot be downloaded
automatically, users can use their ETAD product obtained from other
sources with this option.</li><li>Option 1: This is for applications
where accurate geolocation is required. With this option, the azimuth
and slant range delays are estimated for each pixel and image is
resampled to correct the errors caused by the delays.</li><li>Resampling Type: The interpolation methods used for resampling the image. </li><li>ETAD
Correction Layers: The range and azimuth correction layers available
for ETAD correction. Users can select the layers that matter to their
applications. Note that the "Sum Of Range Corrections" layer
contains all the individual range correction layers in it, and the "Sum
Of Azimuth Corrections" contains all the individual azimuth correction
layers. Therefore, they should not be selected together with any of the
individual layers.</li><li>Option 2: This is for InSAR applications
where the range corrections are converted to phase correction which is
saved as a tie point grid in the output product. This phase correction
is eventually used by the Interferogram operator in correcting
interferometric phase. </li></ul>
