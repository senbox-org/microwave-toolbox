<h3>Batch SNAPHU Unwrapping</h3>
<p>
    This tool is for the SNAP/PyRate integration but it is useful as a standalone tool as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    Given an input folder created by SNAPHU Unwrap containing multiple SNAPHU config files and interferograms, such as
    a stack produced by the Multi-Reference InSAR tool, this tool will download the appropriate SNAPHU binary for your
    system (or you can simply provide a pre-existing SNAPHU binary in the install location parameter), and then unwrap
    directly within SNAP. It also takes care of importing all the bands back into SNAP, creating a target product that
    replaces the wrapped interferogram bands with the unwrapped interferogram bands.
    <br> <br>
    Logs for all SNAPHU runs are written out to the SNAPHU export directory, with the progress monitor printing out the
    current export step.
    <br><br>
    More information on phase unwrapping and how SNAPHU operates can be found in the corresponding SNAPHU export help
    pages.
