<p>
  PyRate is an open source tool developed by GeoScience Australia that calculates surface velocity from a stack of unwrapped
  interferogram in an SBAS network. You can read the documentation and how to install it on their
  <a href="https://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/PyRate/">official website</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  The workflow to prepare a dataset for PyRate is to first co-register your radar scenes (e.g. Back geocoding for sentinel-1),
  produce a stack of interferograms using Multi-Reference InSAR,
  apply any calibrations such as Goldstein phase filtering, and then run SNAPHU Export to ready the product for unwrapping.
  <br><br>
  Now that we have prepared our input dataset, we can now run it through this tool. This tool is a pre-configured graph
  which does the following:
  <br>
  <ul>
  <li> SNAPHU unwrap is called on each SNAPHU configuration file using Batch Snaphu Unwrap. Once all unwrapped, these
  unwrapped bands are imported back into the original product, replacing the wrapped interferograms.
  </li>
  <li>
    The unwrapped product is then terrain corrected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, the inputs to PyRate are generated. Coherence and phase bands are written out as geotiffs, along with the DEM.
    GAMMA headers are also written out with the specific metadata tags re-mapped to how PyRate expects them to be labelled,
    and a runtime configuration file is created. Some parameters are exposed by this tool, but more processing options are
    available to be modified within the input_parameters.conf file.
  </li>

</ul>
<br>
PyRate can then be executed from this directory by running the command <br>
<b>pyrate workflow -f input_parameters.conf</b>
<br>
